# -Titanic-s-data-analyticas-and-machine-learning
Our target's to predict the surviving from Titanic and its relation to class and sex using Logistic regression machine learning.  We're going to import our libraries. Read the data from csv files which brought from Kaggle.com. We have two sets for training and testing. Perform data cleaning for our data. Data visualization using different plots and heatmap. Build our machine learning by logistic regression model. Evaluation of our model and predictions.
